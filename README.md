# Search API

Search API (n√©e "rummager") indexes content into [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch)
and serves the GOV.UK Search API.

GOV.UK applications use the API to search and filter GOV.UK content.
For example, [alphagov/finder-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend) uses
the search API to render finder pages (such as [gov.uk/aaib-reports](https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports)).
[search-api-v2](https://github.com/alphagov/search-api-v2) replaces Search API in several areas: for the latest on this, visit <https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/govuk-search.html>.

Search API also provides a public API: https://www.gov.uk/api/search.json?q=taxes.
