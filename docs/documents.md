# Documents API (to be deprecated)

> **Note**: Once whitehall and Search Admin are using the [new indexing process](new-indexing-process.md),
the documents API will be removed and search API will consume only from the publishing API.

### `POST /:index/documents`

Insert or overwrite a document.

There must be a link attribute in the JSON body.

Any fields which are not part of the schema for the document type you are posting
will be silently ignored (see config/schema).
