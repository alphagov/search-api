#
# When indexing a promoted item, the promoted_for field is set with the given
# terms. At search time an extra query checks for matches between the user's
# search phrase and the promoted item. The promoted item search does not have
# a minimum_should_match so even a single word in common will trigger the
# boosting. Any matches are boosted by 100x effectively forcing them to the
# top.
#
# NOTES:
#  - if you add items to this section, the index will need to be re-built
#  - the terms are stemmed so there's no need to enter both 'job' and 'jobs'
